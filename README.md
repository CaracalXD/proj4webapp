# SOWproj4
Preserving Protractor work as example.

# What it does
The automated tests contained in the repository were meant to provide rapid validation of the application under test (AUT). The AUT was designed to be "Read-Only", meaning it retrieved and displayed content from the affiliated database only. There are no 'functional' tests as the AUT did not contain functional components.

These tests are no longer in development, thus the incompletion of some files.

## Note
The automated tests contained in the repository utilize XPATH locators to CSS locators (for example). The AUT was not automation ideal in terms of locator choice best practices. Improvement in best practices is expected for future automation work/attempts.
